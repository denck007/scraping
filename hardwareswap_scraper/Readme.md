# Web scraper for r/hardwareswap using pushshift.io

I was curious what the historical prices were for various nvidia gpus, specificially the 970,980,1070,1080,2070,2080 cards. The code is broken up into a bunch of serial manual commands. As I figured out each major step, I just created a new script.

## Results:
